# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
I spearheaded a Twitter sentiment analysis endeavor, employing machine
learning to decode public sentiments from 31,961 product and event-related tweets. Through data preprocessing, including lemmatization, and insightful visualization, we identified Logistic Regression as a
top performer for sentiment classification. This project underscores my mastery in machine learning, data
preprocessing, and sentiment analysis.
